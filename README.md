# Keysword

Sick and tired to lose your private key or by necessity to carry it with you all the time? 

Say no more. By using this app with a novel rainbow-table-strong algorithm you can generate a key pair of your own from a password at an instant. Now *curve25519*, *P-256*, *RSA* and *bitcoin* types are available. Further explanations in help:


```
usage: keysword2.py [-h] -k KEY_TYPE [-r RSA_SIZE] -b BRANCHES -n NUMBER
                    [-a KEY_AMOUNT] [-f SAVE_TYPE]

USE IT ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING.

You can generate a key pairs of curve25519, P-256, RSA or bitcoin types from you STRONG password. 
By using branching (basically it's BIP-0032 look-a-like rip-off) and choose a particular number 
of key pair (up to 100 in default) in the branched state you can defend yourself from rainbow 
tables attack. Curve25519 will be in hex, P-256 and RSA in PEM armor.

Examples:

python keysword.py -k curve25519 -b '[1,4333,45453,64,99,3245]' -n 77
python keysword.py -k RSA -r 1024 -b '[410,111,123]' -n 12
python keysword.py -k P-256 -b '[1,4100,4773,199,7445]' -n 168 -a 1000
python keysword.py -k curve25519 -b '[111]' -n 77 -a 10 -f separated

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -k KEY_TYPE, --key-type KEY_TYPE
                        Select a type of a key (only curve25519, P-256, RSA or
                        bitcoin are allowed)
  -r RSA_SIZE, --rsa-size RSA_SIZE
                        Select a size of RSA key
  -b BRANCHES, --branches BRANCHES
                        Type a branching policy, in a '[number1,...,numberX]'
                        format.
  -n NUMBER, --number NUMBER
                        Select a number of a key pair you want to use in a
                        generated branched tree
  -a KEY_AMOUNT, --key-amount KEY_AMOUNT
                        Select a key amount. The bigger the number, the longer
                        it'll take to generate keys (mostly for RSA, like 15
                        min for ten 4096 bit RSA keys).
  -f SAVE_TYPE, --save-type SAVE_TYPE
                        You can choose "json" to save all the keys in one file
                        in json format or "separated" to save pairs in
                        separate txt files (first - secret, second - public or
                        address in case of bitcoin).
